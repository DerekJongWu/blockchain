Experimenting with blockchain 

Following this [tutorial](https://medium.com/pythoneers/building-a-blockchain-from-scratch-with-python-489e7116142e) as a foundation. 

As referenced in the tutorial. The key components of the blockchain is: 

1. Distributed Ledger: This is a decentralized database that stores all the transactions that have occurred on the blockchain.
2. Blocks: Each block contains a set of transactions, and each block is linked to the previous block through a cryptographic hash.
3. Cryptographic Hash: This is a unique digital signature that is created for each block. It is used to verify the integrity of the block and to link it to the previous block.
4. Consensus Mechanism: This is a process by which the network participants in the blockchain network reach agreement on the validity of a new block that is added to the chain.
5. Mining: This is the process by which network participants compete to add new blocks to the chain. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for successfully adding a new block.
